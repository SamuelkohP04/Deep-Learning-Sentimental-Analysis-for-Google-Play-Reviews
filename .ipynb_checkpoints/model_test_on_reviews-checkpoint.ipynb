Remind me again how this is the biggest streaming media app out there? I gave them 2 stars just because of their content quality and variety, 1 star for everything else.\n",
      "A loyal Netflix user, I must say how utterly disappointed I am by the poor and scarce collection of shows and movies on such a popular streaming service. Recently, there are hardly any watchable shows to put on, and the few that are do not even find their way in some countries. Hulu is a much better place to stream genuinely good stuff, but unfortunately the streaming is limited to US.\n",

At the rate going They're really going to be the first streaming platform to go blockbuster.\n",
      "I would like to address a new change that Netflix implemented to the home screen. Now the stuff is at the top which you can't just get to so you have to scroll all the way back up through content to get to it restarting your whole scroll. Netflix continues to raise prices but it feel like this increase in price only has produced a decrease im functionality. I Highly recommend it be returned to its current side function.

I use multiple ott platforms all are working good with same connectivity but netflix only have problem . It is opt for only mobile device and using mobile data.if we use wifi data its take too much of time. If this issue resolved mean netflix will reach higher number of subscriber.also we want dubbed local regional language in tamil..\n",
      "After this current cost increase I am now beginning to question whether it is worth continuing my membership. The Netflix I enjoy keep getting cancelled and rather that focusing on developing or improving the shows to appeal to a larger audience they are canceled and three more unappealing shows take its place.I am beginning to feel like my money is just funding a dumping ground for IP's. This is the last cost increase I will pay if I don't see an improvement in Netflix's production efforts.\n",

      "So the reason why I am giving Netflix 2stars is because they have shows on it and they take them off and then I have to wait for the show to come back on Netflix. Don't get me wrong Netflix is great but there are not a lot of new shows on it which is a little bit annoying 😔😔\n",
      "I used to love Netflix I've been with them since year one without any customer loyalty or perks through out the price hikes and package changes but the low quality choices and short cutting of series has become too common and the propaganda political bias and material leave a bitter taste it's like they stopped trying if this doesn't change I'm done.. basic though over priced is what I reduced to strictly for the series that only give you 1 to 3 seasons and cliff hang to be forgotten..\n",

      "The current netflix update which is the netflix household is a serious matter with me. Those who are not using the main connection or internet with the main account would be asked to update netflix household on their tv everytime they will watch. It's too troublesome and the only solution is to add a member slot which means additional expenses. What's the point of availing the premium plan for my family if i have to spend more than I should have. Make it make sense.\n",

      "Netflix now has hardly any good shows/movies. A lot of the time the good shows/movies they have will get removed or sometimes only have 1 season. Really the only good side to Netflix is they probably have the best speed and layout of any other streaming service.\n",

      "This is constantly hacked. I had to give up my account, my aunt had to give up her account, and my mom had to give up her account. Make a two step verification or something.\n",
      "The most recent look of Netflix is now a deal breaker and like prime will be removing the app from my phone and use the browser version instead. Unlike prime which I access for shopping, Netflix is only for streaming meaning I'm more than willing to cancel. Maybe if enough people drop the mobile app Netflix might worry about more than the bottom line and start listening to their users feedback.\n",

Thus increasing money because of scarcity.\n",

You guys dont make good shows and if you do you cancel them instantly because of not enough views maybe if you add a second season and then it doesnt get views then you can stop production on the show. Example: Lockwood and Co it has a great beggining but at the end there are so many mysteries and possibilities with the show if you added a second season i think it would get enough views.

The app itself similarly gets worse every year or so, and the descriptions of the shows betray how little effort Netflix cares to put into the presentation as many of them don't even tell you what the movie is about simply saying movie stars X actor or Y person said it was good. If even Netflix doesn't care enough about their content to tell you what it is then that's a pretty damning indictment.\n",

Example: Lockwood and Co it has a great beggining but at the end there are so many mysteries and possibilities with the show if you added a second season i think it would get enough views.

I found the white text on clear background is hard to read on light colored movie scenes. Yellow text with black outline or with light opaque black background will make the text stand out more on any movie scenes. Second is there is no setting for the font size. The larger text that I can choose is another big help to see the movie from a distance. These should be included in the setting for the subtitle where user can choose to set up. I would have given a 5 stars had the app allowed me to do the above.\n",

I found the white text on clear background is hard to read on light colored movie scenes. Yellow text with black outline or with light opaque black background will make the text stand out more on any movie scenes. Second is there is no setting for the font size. The larger text that I can choose is another big help to see the movie from a distance. These should be included in the setting for the subtitle where user can choose to set up.

Most times I'll like to watch the full episode at least once, but in case of cowboy bebop it's almost a crime to force viewers to go back an episode to hear \"The Real Folk Blues\". You can't just cut out such a beautiful memory.. at least make ending sequences a button skip like openings.\n",

      "I have watched so many movies since I had surgery back in 08/2022. Netflix offers a lot of entertainment for the amount that you pay a month unless you are home for an extended amount of time. I'm sure many people found the new game of \"Movie Roulette\" while home during the high point of COVID. I happened to be an essential employee during COVID-19 outbreak. So at least I got to keep working. The roulette game is picking a movie by the picture that advertised it on the streaming service.\n",

Given the idea of AI voice I think you can create voice caption where it uses the actual voice via AI to those videos problem is no voice actor can hire but the good thing is the voice still use the actual voice actor. So translation/caption in english or other languages are not needed. I guess this will be a phenomenal when it happens 🫶🏽, sort of like improvement for captions something like that.
